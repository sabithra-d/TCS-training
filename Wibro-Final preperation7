Chemicals,the consistent rate of change; and the Nth second for which the scientist wishes to 
calculate the total energy produced, respectively.

Output

Print an integer representing the total energy produced by the Nth second.

Example

Input:

5 3 3
5->e 
3->r 
3->t 

1 st second =>  5 

2 nd second =>  5+3 = 8 

3 rd second =>  8+3 = 11 

5+8+11 = 24 

Output:24
