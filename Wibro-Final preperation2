A company wishes to encode its data. The data is in the form of a number. They wish to encode the data with
respect to a specific digit. They wish to count the number of times the specific digit (i.e 0-9) reoccurs in
the given data so that they can encode the data accordingly.
Write an algorithm to find the count of the specific digit in the given data.
Input
The input consists of two space-separated integers data and digit, representing the data to be encoded and the digit to be counted in the data.
Output
Print an integer representing the count of the specific digit.
Example
Input: 
572378233 3
Output:
3


n=int(input())
d=int(input())
count=0
while(n!=0):
    r=n%10
    if(r==d):
        count+=1 
    n=n//10
print(count)
