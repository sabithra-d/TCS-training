/*
You are playing an online game. In the game, a numbers is displayed on the screen.
In order to win the game, you have to Count the trailing zeros in the factorial value of the
given number. Write an algorithm to count the trailing zeros in the factorial value of the given number.

Input
The input consists of an integer num, representing the number displayed on the screen.
Output
Print An integer representing the count of trailing zeros in the factorial of the given numbers.
Note
The factorial of the number is calculated as the product of integer numbers from 1 to num.

Example
Input
5
Output:
1



5!--> 120  --> 1 
6! -> 720  --> 1 
7! -> 5040 -> 1 


10! -->3628800 --> 2 

11!-->39916800 --> 2 
12 ,13,14  --> 2

15 -> 3 
20 -> 4 
25 -> 5 + 1(25)  --> 6 


100 --> 20+ 4 --> 24 


250 --> 50(5)+ 10(25)+2(125) --> 62
