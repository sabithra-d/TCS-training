to find the highest revenue received each day.
Input
The first line of the input consists of two space-separatedIntegers-days (M) and products(N),
representing the days and the products in the sales record.
The next M lines consist of N space-separated integers representing the sales revenue received 
from each product each day.

Output
Print M space-separated integers representing the maximum received each day.
