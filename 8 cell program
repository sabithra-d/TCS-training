/* 
8 cell program

There is a colony of 8 cells arranged in a straight line where each day every cell competes 
with its adjacent cells(neighbour). Each day, for each cell, if its neighbours are both active 
or both inactive, the cell becomes inactive the next day, otherwise it becomes active the next day.
Assumptions: The two cells on the ends have single adjacent cell, so the other adjacent cell 
can be assumed to be always inactive. Even after updating the cell state. consider its 
previous state for updating the state of other cells. Update the cell information of all
cells simultaneously. Write a function cellCompete which takes takes one 8 element array of
integers cells representing the current state of 8 cells and one integer days representing
the number of days to simulate. An integer value of 1 represents an active cell
and value of 0 represents an inactive cell.

Input Format
Input will have 8 array values and the no of days
Output Format
print the array
Constraints
array size is 8 integers
Sample Input 
1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
1
Sample Output
0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
