An e-commerce site wishes to enhance its rdering process. They plan to implement a new
scheme of OTP (one time password) generation for order confirmation. The OTP can be any number of digits. 
For OTP generation, the user will be asked to enter two random numbers. The first number entered should
always be smaller than the second number. The OTP is calculated as the sum of the maximum and the minimum 
prime values in the range of the user-entered numbers.
Write an algorithm to find the OTP.
Input
The input consists of two space-separated integers - firstNumber and secondNumber,representing the two numbers  entered by the user. Both numbers are considered in the range.
Output
Print an integer representing the sum of the largest and smallest prime numbers in the range of given numbers.
Example
Input:
10 24      11 13 16 17 19 22 23   11+23=34
Output:
34

start=int(input())
end=int(input())
l=[]
for i in range(start,end+1):
    for j in range(2,i):
        if i % j == 0:
            break
    else:
        l.append(i)
a=min(l)
b=max(l)
print(a+b)
